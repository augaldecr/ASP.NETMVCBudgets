# ASP.NETMVCBudgets
Educational purposes  Based on Felipe Gavil√°n's courses. All credits to him. I just made some totally subjective changes to use the latest .NET features https://www.felipe-gavilan.com/cursos?idioma=eng.

This is an educational project, aimed at providing an overview of ASP .NET core MCV type applications. It includes JQuery, which could be considered a bad practice, although there are still many applications that do it. I will, eventually, remove the use of it and send it to the original creator for review.
