# ASP.NETMVCBudgets
Educational purposes  Based on Felipe Gavil√°n's courses. All credits to him. I just made some totally subjective changes to use the latest .NET features https://www.felipe-gavilan.com/cursos?idioma=eng.

This is an educational project, aimed at providing an overview of ASP .NET core MCV type applications. Due to the purpose of keeping it understandable for newbies, it includes JQuery, which could be considered a bad practice (among other details such as programming in Spanish, the use of characters not belonging to the English alphabet, etc.), although there are still many applications that use it. I will, eventually, remove the use of it and send it to the original creator for review.
